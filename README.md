API Testing for Open Charge Map API

Overview

This project contains API tests for the Open Charge Map API, focusing on two endpoints:

Get POIs (Points of Interest)

Get Reference Data

The tests cover response time, status codes, response data schema validation, and business logic verification.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Install Postman or any API testing tool of your choice (e.g., REST Assured, Karate, Newman CLI).

Obtain an API key from Open Charge Map (if required).

Importing the Tests

Using Postman

Open Postman.

Click on Import in the top-left corner.

Upload the provided Postman collection file (OpenChargeMapTests.postman_collection.json).

(Optional) Add the environment file if needed.

Using Newman (CLI for Postman)

Install Newman via npm:

Run the test collection:

Test Cases

Get POIs Endpoint

Response Time & Status Code

✅ Verify response time is under 1000ms

✅ Confirm status code is 200

Schema Validation

✅ Response contains an array of POI objects

✅ Each POI object includes:

ID

AddressInfo (containing Latitude and Longitude)

NumberOfPoints

Business Logic Validation

✅ Request with latitude=51.5074&longitude=0.1278&distance=10&maxresults=5 returns exactly 5 results

✅ Ensure all returned POIs are within 10km of the specified coordinates

Get Reference Data Endpoint

Response Time & Status Code

✅ Verify response time is under 1000ms

✅ Confirm status code is 200

Schema Validation

✅ Response contains arrays for ChargerTypes and StatusTypes

✅ Each item in these arrays has an ID and Title

Business Logic Validation

✅ ChargerTypes includes both Fast and Slow chargers

✅ Ensure all StatusTypes have unique IDs

Test Results & Observations

Summary

✅ All API requests responded within the expected time limits (<1000ms).

✅ Status codes were as expected (200 OK).

✅ Schema validation passed for all responses.

⚠️ Some POIs were found slightly beyond the 10km range (suggests minor inaccuracies in the dataset).

✅ Business logic checks passed for reference data, including unique IDs and charger type verification.

Limitations & Assumptions

Rate Limits: Open Charge Map API might enforce rate limits on requests.

Data Updates: The database may change, affecting location-based validation.

Geographical Precision: POI distance verification relies on approximate geospatial calculations.

Log files and additional test execution reports can be included for deeper analysis.
